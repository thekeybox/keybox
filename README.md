i. Keybox encrypts and fragments data into multiple unique parts

ii. The fragments are distributed across a decentralized network of private or public nodes

iii. Only a subset of the fragments is needed to recreate the whole

iv. The data can only be accessed through the recombination process via smart contracts

v. A redundancy threshold ensures that the failure of a node does not affect the integrity of the data


ried and tested security algorithms


Keybox uses MITâ€™s Shamir Secret Sharing to fragment data together with smart

contracts to control and monitor data access



Permissioned blockchain

Keybox leverages a proven, permissioned Blockchain, which has several unique

advantages over other distributed ledger protocols, including territoriality and scalability


Strong focus on usability

The Keybox API and SDK offer enterprises a seaplss experience in managing their

data at rest or in transit, within their existing data infrastructure
